Welcome to my academic website. I am a PhD student at the University of Vienna.

I'm particularly intrigued by the dynamics of life cycles, financial constraints, and broader macroeconomic principles. I employ a blend of empirical and quantitative methodologies to explore and address my research questions.

My advisors are [Monika Merz](https://sites.google.com/view/monikamerz){target="_blank"} and [Michael Reiter](https://www.ihs.ac.at/de/personen/michael-reiter/){target="_blank"}.

    This paper studies the role of heterogeneous risk preferences in shaping entrepreneurial decisions and their implications for wealth inequality. We examine how individualsâ€™ risk attitudes guide their choice between becoming a risk-bearing entrepreneur and a wage worker with a more stable income. To empirically ground our study, we use self-reported risk attitudes among the German workforce based on data from the German Socioeconomic Panel (GSOEP) and estimate their impact on the likelihood of workers transitioning into self-employment. Our findings highlight that risk tolerance is a key determinant in opting for entrepreneurship. We further build a life-cycle model of occupational choice that features heterogeneous risk preferences and explore how these choices influence savings/investment and wealth accumulation. Our preliminary results reveal that a model featuring heterogeneous risk preferences not only successfully captures the distribution of wealth in Germany, but also does so more accurately compared to models assuming uniform risk attitudes across individuals. </div>
